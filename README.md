# Deep-Spatial-Transformers
The deep learning codes implement 
   1) An conv encoder-decoder
   2) An STN with bilinear interpolation
   
The MATLAB codes build the LES solver for 2-layered QG. Details of the implementation can be found in this paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL084863
The code has been originally developed by Pedram Hassanzadeh (pedram@rice.edu)
